Arc Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy

This document outlines how we’ll launch Arc to the world and build early momentum toward our first 10k–50k users and our initial base of creators.

Core Launch Narrative

Life isn’t a main quest. It’s a series of side quests. Arc gives you the missions, the map, and the myth to live by. Whether you’re broke and barefoot or loaded and lost, Arc turns your choices into lore—and helps you share it.

Tagline: Make life lore.
