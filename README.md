# SideQuest

## Product Vision

SideQuest transforms ordinary life into an extraordinary adventure. It reframes daily experiences as real-life side quests—spontaneous, soulful, chaotic, or transformative—with the ultimate goal of building a living, breathing archive of modern human lore. Through community storytelling, AI-generated quests, and map-based interactivity, SideQuest gives people permission to play again—without the need for wealth, status, or perfection.

Life isn’t a main quest. It’s a series of side quests. Let’s live accordingly.

## Product Goals

1. **Inspire Action:** Use AI to suggest compelling side quests based on time, money, distance, and personal vibe.
2. **Build Lore:** Enable people to document and share their quests—creating a global, user-generated archive of human experience.
3. **Create Community:** Connect questers through map-based tracking, shared interests, and real-time progress updates.
4. **Support Monetization:** Let creators monetize their quests via AMA access, premium content, and patronage.
5. **Make Life Playable:** Turn real-world exploration, growth, and chaos into a gamified system.
