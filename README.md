# Arc

## Product Vision

Arc transforms ordinary life into an extraordinary narrative. It reframes your day-to-day into a series of meaningful, wild, or ridiculous real-world side quests—each logged, shared, and remembered as modern human lore. Whether you’ve got €10 and a bike or \$5k and a spiritual calling, Arc gives you a mission, a map, and a myth to live by.

This is not about the main quest. It’s about all the side quests that make life real. **Arc helps you live with intention—and leave a legacy.**

## Product Goals

1. **Inspire Action:** Use GPT to suggest compelling side quests based on time, money, location, and vibe.
2. **Build Lore:** Let people document and share their quests—creating a global, user-driven archive of life stories.
3. **Create Connection:** Help people find, follow, and interact with others on their own arcs through map-based tracking, AMAs, and content.
4. **Enable Monetization:** Let questers earn from their journeys via AMA access, premium BTS content, and sponsorships.
5. **Make Life Playable:** Turn real-world chaos and curiosity into a gamified system that rewards living differently.
