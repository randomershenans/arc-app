Arc

Product Vision

Arc transforms ordinary life into an extraordinary narrative. It reframes your day-to-day into a series of meaningful, wild, or ridiculous real-world side quests—each logged, shared, and remembered as modern human lore. Whether you’ve got €10 and a bike or $5k and a spiritual calling, Arc gives you a mission, a map, and a myth to live by.

This is not about the main quest. It’s about all the side quests that make life real. Arc helps you live with intention—and leave a legacy.

Product Goals

Inspire Action: Use GPT to suggest compelling side quests based on time, money, location, and vibe.

Build Lore: Let people document and share their quests—creating a global, user-driven archive of life stories.

Create Connection: Help people find, follow, and interact with others on their own arcs through map-based tracking, AMAs, and content.

Enable Monetization: Let questers earn from their journeys via AMA access, premium BTS content, and sponsorships.

Make Life Playable: Turn real-world chaos and curiosity into a gamified system that rewards living differently.
