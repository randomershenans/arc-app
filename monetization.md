# Arc Monetization Strategy

Arc’s monetization is designed to empower users, not exploit them. Every revenue stream is tied to enhancing user expression, connection, and the creation of meaningful lore.

## 1. Arc+ (Premium Subscription)

**Price:** €4.99/month or €40/year

### Includes:

* Unlimited GPT quest generation
* “LoreBoost” for visibility in the feed/map
* Full map access (not radius-limited)
* Access to exclusive legendary quests
* Unlock premium templates (if creator allows inclusion)
* Choose your AI mentor style (e.g. cryptic monk, hype knight, rogue wizard)

---

## 2. AMA System (Ask Me Anything)

Creators can enable Q\&A per quest.

### Mechanics:

* Anyone can pay €1–€5 to ask a quester a question
* Creator can respond via text, audio, or video
* Creator only gets paid if they answer
* Arc takes 10–20% platform fee

---

## 3. Behind-The-Quest Subscriptions

Let followers pay for deeper insights.

### Creator Set Price Options:

* €2.99 / €4.99 / €9.99 monthly

### Content types:

* Gear lists
* Budget breakdowns
* Real-time updates
* Travel hacks, contacts
* Extended photo/video content
* Reflection posts

---

## 4. One-Off Template Sales

Templates = downloadable or viewable premium content:

* “What I Wish I Knew Before…”
* Packing list for this quest type
* Budget spreadsheet
* Gear-by-location guide

### Price:

* Creator chooses price (€0.99–€19.99)
* Arc takes 10–20%
* Option for creators to include in Arc+ by ticking a checkbox

---

## 5. Lore Merch

Once the app has community traction:

* Quest patches
* Personalized quest books
* Stickers and lore passports
* “Certified Lorecrafter” shirts or hoodies

Manufactured on-demand; Arc takes margin.

---

## 6. Sponsored Quests

Long-term optional revenue path:

* Work with aligned brands (adventure gear, travel apps, alt-ed orgs)
* Brand presents a “Sponsored Arc” with a clear theme
* Creators can opt-in and receive perks or payment

Must be brand-safe and lore-enhancing only—no boring shills.
