# Arc Growth Plan

This document outlines the long-term growth strategy for Arc post-launch. It maps out how to scale from 10k users to 1M+ while increasing monetization, retention, and community depth.

---

## New Arc+ Feature: Quest Control

Let followers shape your journey by voting on or submitting side quests.

**Free Users:**

* Vote in public polls
* See winning quests unfold

**Arc+ Users:**

* Submit full quests or cursed mini-missions
* Vote in exclusive polls
* Get shoutouts in lore logs as the quest creator

This mechanic creates deep community engagement and a natural upgrade funnel—fans influence the story and pay to do so.

## Growth Flywheel

**Creators → Content → Community → Conversion → Creators**

* More creators = more quests = more discovery
* Community engagement increases perceived value
* Arc+ and monetization unlock deeper usage
* Revenue reinvested into better creator tooling and discovery

## Phase-Based Growth Strategy

### 🔥 Phase 1: 10k → 50k Users

**Goal:** Prove product-market fit & get core quest activity flowing

* Highlight most chaotic/inspiring quests weekly on socials
* Lean into real-time updates (Lore Logs) for virality
* Trigger referrals from Bucket List adds (“Want to do this too?”)
* Build Arc+ conversions via AI style unlocks + map freedom
* Run monthly Creator Spotlights with quester earnings breakdown

### 🚀 Phase 2: 50k → 250k Users

**Goal:** Scale creator network + reinforce monetization loop

* Enable creator invite codes (with % bonus for lifetime earnings)
* “Quester Academy” onboarding mini-site for aspiring earners
* Build Lore Challenges (e.g. 5-day public quest streak = prize)
* Add more AI prompt styles and challenge modes
* Launch official Arc+ referral campaign (get 1 month free)

### 🌍 Phase 3: 250k → 1M+ Users

**Goal:** Become *the* platform for real-world adventure & lore

* Partner with aligned YouTubers, TikTokers, and outdoor creators
* Introduce Lore League (regional team-based quests)
* Add multiplayer quests (2+ people log the same arc)
* Expand merch offering and event collabs
* Activate brand sponsors for Legendary Quests

## Retention Strategy

Push Notifications: "X just posted a new quest update" sent to followers (even non-subscribers)

Leverage notifications to create FOMO and real-time excitement

Weekly “Lore Drops” from your followed users

Re-engagement push for abandoned quests

Bucket List nudges: “Others are doing this now!”

Monthly leaderboard/lore rank emails
